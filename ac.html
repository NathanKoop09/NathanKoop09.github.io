            <p class="para">
                This game contains two main modes of play: remote play with other players on different clients, and local play against non-player-characters.<br>
        The remote play option makes use of Unity Relay and Lobby services to allow for local game hosting. Each client runs their own Game Board manager which is in charge of displaying the state of the board and calculating available moves for the player. On the server is the game manager which is in charge of managing turn order and broadcasting messages to each client as needed. All moves are encoded in a two byte bit field in order to limit the amount of data needed to be sent over the network.<br>
        The local play option contains four different NPC difficulties created in a structure that allows for easy scalability. Each NPC attempts to maximize their given cost functions. For the medium NPC they try to eat as many animals as possible, hard tries to eat as many animals as possible that aren't on that npc's team, and impossible tries to eat as many primaries as possible.

            <h2 class="subheader">Project Description</h2>
            <p class="para">
                An easy to learn board game in which you try to discover and eliminate your opponents primary animal while keeping the identity of your primary animal secret. You can play against your friends remotely, or chose to play against bot players of four different difficulties: from easy to impossible. <br>
        Once the game starts each player takes a turn picking an animal to be a part of their team. Once all players have selected their teams it's time for each player to secretly make a decision on which of their animals shall be their primary. Next, players take turns placing an animal on the board anywhere they want. Make sure you don't put your primary in an obvious spot or else it's game over. After all the pieces have been placed each player will take turns rolling and moving whatever animal they want in an attempt to eat the other players primary.
